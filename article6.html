                <aside class="inside">
              <p><span class="firstletter">O</span>ne could easily be forgiven for thinking that life bears little connection to rocks. From high-school science curricula to Wikipedia, the institutional separation of geology and biology seems as ingrained today as when the 18th-century Swedish botanist <span class="person" about="Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</span> first distinguished animals, vegetables, and minerals. After all, what could be more different than a fragrant rose and a cold chunk of granite?</p>

              <p>Minerals are usually defined as naturally occurring <em>inorganic substances</em> that combine to form rocks. Until recently, many geologists assumed that most rocks had been around since the origins of <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span>, well before life formed on this planet. Even <q>biominerals</q> such as calcite and apatite, which organisms secrete to form shells, teeth and bones, are merely recent examples of very ancient and rather common non-biological materials. No wonder, then, that when I asked my PhD adviser if I should take a biology course as a capstone to my graduate studies, his response was: <q>Why? You&apos;re a mineralogist. You&apos;ll never use biology!</q></p>

              <p><div class="p2">For more than 20 years, my career flourished in blissful ignorance of microbes and mollusks, teeth and bone. But my perceptions changed a bit in 1996, when I began to research the origins of life.</div> Four decades earlier, the US chemists <span class="person" about="Miller">Stanley Miller</span> and <span class="person" about="Urey">Harold Urey</span> had performed their <span class="custom-t1">famous simulation</span> of <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> earliest years by mixing water (ie, oceans), gases (the atmosphere) and little sparks (lightning) in order to generate the basic biological building blocks. Minerals weren&apos;t part of the <span class="person" about="Miller">Miller</span>-<span class="person" about="Urey">Urey</span> experiment – their amino acids and sugars formed perfectly well without crystals cluttering up the reactions. But as the decades passed, the assembly of those building blocks into more lifelike macromolecules – such as proteins and DNA – proved difficult. And so theorists gradually brought minerals such as quartz-rich beach sand, shiny iron pyrite and fine-grained clay into the story. They said these minerals helped to select, concentrate and assemble small molecules into bigger molecules, while protecting the more delicate bio-bits from the ravages of <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> hostile early environment. Now, almost everyone in the field agrees that mineral variety is essential to biogenesis, which means life and rocks have been together since the very beginning.</p>

              <p>Life is thought to have arisen in the <span class="concept" about="Archean aeon">Archaean aeon</span>, some 4 billion years ago, when <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> was blanketed by a thick noxious atmosphere tinged orange with hydrocarbon smog. The seas and the land were both barren then, and the raw materials of life – water, air, rocks – were bathed in lethal ultraviolet radiation. The planet&apos;s surface was marred by a steady stream of violent volcanic eruptions, asteroid bombardments and icy comet impacts. How could that alien, volcanic, comet-battered globe produce living molecules? The story is that minerals – quartz, pyrite, clays, and the like – must have provided the safe, shielded environments that spawned life. But for this theory to be true, those critical life-triggering minerals had to have been present when life first formed. Recent discoveries indicate that planetary mineralogy evolves, and that some minerals took a billion years or more to appear. How can we know that the crucial ones were around way back then?</p>

                <p><span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> near-surface mineralogy has changed radically in both diversity and distribution during its 4.5 billion year history. And we now know what caused these radical changes: basic chemistry, physics and, most surprisingly, biology. We also know that these general principles apply to the trillions upon trillions of rocky planets and moons that exist throughout the cosmos. This new evolutionary perspective is detailed enough to let us travel back in time, to the formation of the first minerals in <em>the universe</em>. We know that no minerals could have formed right after the <span class="concept" about="Big Bang">Big Bang</span>, for the universe was much too hot, and there weren&apos;t enough mineral-forming elements around. Almost nothing except the gaseous elements hydrogen and helium could have existed then. Nor did any minerals form inside the first stars, which were too hot to support solid crystals.</p>
            
              <p>Modelling the outcome of the entangled and rapidly declining relationship between humans and <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> has become a key task for scientists across a range of fields, which has led to a blurring of scientific and political futures. The closer this relationship gets, the harder it becomes to disentangle the two from each other. For someone like myself, born in the mid-1990s, models of planetary conditions have almost become images of the future itself. The planet is suddenly <em>everywhere</em>. Planning, designing, research, strategising – even the grounds for thinking itself – are now adjusted to the planetary scale. As this scale becomes ubiquitous, it can sometimes be difficult to see that this form of the planet has a history of its own. If the planet just recently resurfaced as a new kind of environmental category, where did it come from?</p>
           
              <p>But when those first stars exploded a few million years after the universe&apos;s birth, their expanding remains cooled, allowing carbon atoms within them to condense into diamonds, and a few other kinds of minute crystals, which are called the <span class="concept" about="Ur-Minerals"><q>ur-minerals</q></span>. Perhaps a dozen mineral species emerged, including graphite (a form of pure carbon that&apos;s used as pencil <q>lead</q>), corundum (most familiar as ruby and sapphire in its coloured forms), and moissanite (a tough compound of silicon and carbon that&apos;s often used as a cheap substitute for diamond gemstones). These ancient species of crystals still fall to <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> today in the form of microscopic interstellar dust, left over from the great nebula that formed the Sun and planets more than 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
           
              <p>The driving question behind mineral evolution is how vast quantities of dust, composed of the original dozen ur-minerals, were processed and reworked to yield the thousands of different minerals on Earth today. All of <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> chemical richness – what we enjoy today as iPhones, skateboards, automobiles, flat-screen TVs, and countless other toys – was sequestered into those primordial dust grains, but in trace quantities. All but a dozen of the 80 or so chemical elements that make up planets were impossibly dilute, constituting only a few atoms in a million, or a billion, or even less. Barring some remarkably efficient concentration processes, the chances of those rare chemical elements clumping together to form separate, distinct mineral species were vanishingly small. To have the mineral diversity we enjoy today, the rocks that make up Earth needed to experience a number of interventions.</p>

                <p>For <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> first half-billion years or so, life played no role in mineral evolution, for there were no living cells on its harsh and desolate surface. The earliest pulse of mineral novelty occurred before planets, when the primitive Sun began to flare, sending plumes of refining fire outward into the nebular disk of dust and gas spinning around it. <span class="custom-t1">The original 12 <span class="concept" about="Ur-Minerals">ur-minerals</span> melted and remixed to generate 60 species,</span> followed by another 100, which emerged when gravity clumped dust and gas into larger and larger planetesimals.  
                        
              <div class="p2">Heat, pressure, and water transformed crystals into new forms, and collisions between rocks produced impact shocks that led to even more mineralogical novelty.</div></p>
            
              <p>As <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> grew larger, dense iron-nickel metal sank through a mantle of rocks to form the planet&apos;s core. Around this great bulk was an outer crust made primarily of black volcanic basalt. Having sorted itself into onion-like layers, <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> boasted a near-surface environment relatively concentrated in dozens of rare elements. Disproportionate amounts of the lightest mineral-forming elements hydrogen, lithium, beryllium and boron were peppered throughout this outer shell. Metal ores of copper, silver, zinc and gold; radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium and radium; key elements of life, including phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and carbon – all enjoyed unusual concentrations in <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> evolving crust.</p>
            
              <p>Early <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> became an engine of mineral production, thanks to the water on its surface, the heat in its deeper layers, and the rock-recycling system of plate tectonics. These, and other physical and chemical processes, combined to form 1,500 different minerals. That&apos;s a sizeable sum to be sure, but today we know of 5,000 different minerals species. What created the remaining 3,500 minerals, which comprise the vast majority of mineral species? The inevitable conclusion – one that has shaken the mineralogical community to its core – is that most minerals (two out of three, in fact) arise as a result of biological processes.</p>
           
              <p><div class="custom-t4">The co-evolutionary story between rocks and life</div> began 4 billion years or so ago, when the planet had only rocks, air and oceans to work with. The origins researchers that followed <span class="person" about="Miller">Miller</span> and <span class="place" about="Urey">Urey&apos;s</span> heady success soon realised that air and oceans aren&apos;t enough to create life, no matter how lightning-filled the sky. Only with the addition of carefully selected minerals will simple, nonliving biomolecules concentrate and combine in complex biologically useful ways. The earliest microbes were <q>chemolithoautotrophs</q> – a fancy name for cells that get their chemical energy from minerals, in order to make their own biomolecules from scratch. Microbes accelerated the breakdown of unstable minerals such as iron, sulphur or carbon, earning a tiny energetic boost in the process.</p>

              <p>The rock-eating microbes transformed the <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> surface, but not nearly as much as <span class="concept" about="GOE">the Great Oxidation Event (GOE)</span>, the single most dramatic event in <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> mineral evolution. Evidence from chemical and physical changes in <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> rocks places the beginning of the <span class="concept" about="GOE">GOE</span> at about 2.4 billion years ago. That&apos;s when photosynthetic microorganisms that used the Sun for energy and manufactured oxygen as a by-product began to flourish along coastlines that were rich in eroded mineral nutrients. Oxygen is a dangerous, corrosive gas, which mounts a chemical attack that alters most rocks and minerals, transforming them into new <q>oxidised</q> forms such as rust. More oxygen in the ancient atmosphere meant more erosion, leading to more nutrients, and even more oxygen-producing algae. This feedback loop has continued to play out in near-surface environments for more than 2 billion years, creating more and more mineral diversity.</p>

              <aside class="inside">
                <p>Take copper, for instance. Before the <span class="concept" about="GOE">GOE</span>, it&apos;s hard to identify more than about a score of likely copper-bearing minerals. But, today, more than 600 different copper minerals have been catalogued, including all the gorgeous blue and green ones such as azurite, malachite and turquoise. Hundreds of minerals combine copper, oxygen and other elements in ways that could not have happened before the evolution of photosynthesis.
                         
              <span class="p2"> Life is likewise responsible for more than 90 per cent of the 200-plus known minerals of uranium</span>, as well as the great majority of minerals of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, lead, arsenic, carbon, sulphur and numerous other elements that readily react with oxygen. Only a living planet could display such mineralogical fecundity.</p>

              <p>Life arose from minerals; then minerals arose from life. The geosphere and biosphere have become complexly intertwined, with numerous feedback loops driving myriad critical natural processes in ways that are only now coming into focus. Photosynthetic microbes created new pathways for making novel minerals of uranium and copper; now, those new uranium and copper minerals provide environments for specialised kinds of microbes, which in turn are instrumental in forming new ore deposits. The rise of atmospheric oxygen was accompanied by a decline in CO2, leading to a decrease in the ocean&apos;s acidity, which fostered the formation of limestone reefs, which provided stable new environments for more photosynthesis. The oxygen produced by photosynthetic microbes also led to the formation of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, which blocked the Sun&apos;s harmful ultraviolet radiation, allowing life to populate shallow coastal areas.</p>
           
              <p>For more than 2 billion years, virtually every facet of <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth&apos;s</span> near-surface environment has displayed the intimate interplay of life and rocks. Indeed, geologists now vie with each other to produce the most novel twists in this epic love story between rocks and life. It has even been suggested that plate tectonics – the grandest of global-scale phenomena, by which continents shift while earthquakes and volcanoes alter the landscape – could be influenced by life. Microbial weathering greatly enhances clay mineral production, and enhanced production of slippery clays has <q>lubricated</q> down-going plates of rock and accelerated tectonic events – at least, that&apos;s how the story goes. A lot of geologists think that idea is wacky. After all, plate tectonics and non-microbial clay production have been around for billions of years. But such hypotheses reveal the extent to which the new co-evolutionary mindset is shaping the thinking of today&apos;s <span class="custom-t2">geoscientists.</span></p>

              <p>Earth has transformed many times, from a black and blasted land of volcanoes, to a blue water world, to an oxygen-rich globe with rusty red continents. Yet no transition was more dramatic than the greening of the planet, and the rise of the terrestrial biosphere, which began about 650 million years ago, when a global glaciation came to an end and explosive growths of photosynthetic algae boosted atmospheric oxygen from perhaps 1 per cent to near-modern levels of 20 per cent. <span class="custom-t2">More oxygen meant a reinforced ozone layer, which shielded the barren continents from those burning ultraviolet rays, making it safe for life to migrate onto dry land.</span></p>

              <p>The first land plants had tiny roots, commensurate with the shallow soil of their homes. But those diminutive roots accelerated the breakdown of rock, creating deeper soils that taller plants could then colonise, with longer and more intrusive roots. In a span of only about 40 million years, vegetation on land evolved into 50-foot tall plants and giant, treelike fungi, all rooted in soils that ran 20 foot deep. Those plants would go on to seed clouds, increasing rainfall and altering erosion patterns, providing still more niches for plants. They also created a robust and vital base for a food web that quickly expanded to include insects, amphibians, dinosaurs, and eventually, us.</p>
