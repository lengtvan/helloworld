              <p><span class="firstletter">I</span>n the late 1670s, the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek looked through a microscope at a drop of water and found a whole world. It was tiny; it was squirmy; it was full of weird body types; and it lived, invisibly, all around us. Humans were supposed to be the centre and purpose of the world, and these microscale <q>animalcules</q> seemed to have no effect – visible or otherwise – on our existence, so why were they here? Now, we know that those animalcules are microbes and they actually rule our world. They make us sick, keep us healthy, decompose our waste, feed the bottom of our food chain, and make our oxygen. Human ignorance of them had no bearing on their significance, just as gravity was important before an apple dropped on Isaac Newton&apos;s head.</p>

              <p>We could be poised on another such philosophical precipice, about to discover a second important world hiding amid our own: alien life on our own planet. Today, scientists seek extraterrestrial microbes in geysers of chilled water shooting from Enceladus and in the ocean sloshing beneath the ice crust of Europa. They search for clues that beings once skittered around the formerly wet rocks of Mars. Telescopes peer into the atmospheres of distant exoplanets, hunting for signs of life. But perhaps these efforts are too far afield. If multiple lines of life bubbled up on Earth and evolved separately from our ancient ancestors, we could discover alien biology without leaving this planet.</p>

              <p><div class="p2">The modern-day descendants of these <q>aliens</q> might still be here, squirming around with van Leeuwenhoe&apos;s microbes.</div> Scientists call these hypothetical hangers-on the <q>shadow biosphere</q>. If a shadow biosphere were ever found, it would provide evidence that life isn’t a once-in-a-universe statistical accident. If biology can happen twice on one planet, it must have happened countless times on countless other planets. But most of our scientific methods are ill-equipped to discover a shadow biosphere. And that&apos;s a problem, says Carol Cleland, the originator of the term and its biggest proponent.</p>

              <p>The idea came to Cleland, a philosopher at the University of Colorado at Boulder, when she spent a sabbatical year at the Centro de Astrobiologi&#769;a in Spain. She was studying the scientists, who were studying microorganisms.</p>

              <p><q>If you have a sample of soil,</q> she asked them, <q>how will you recognise what&apos;s in it?</q> The scientists rattled off the usual answers: slide it under a microscope, put it in a Petri dish, make millions of DNA copies, catalogue the genes. But that party line disturbed Cleland. <q>You couldn&apos&apos;t detect anything that wasn&apos;t almost identical to familiar Earth life,</q> she said. Their methods assumed that all microbes have genetic material that works like ours. Isn&apos;t it possible, Cleland wondered, that life arose more than once here? If so, organisms from a second (or third) genesis would never turn up in our tests, because our tests are only meant to turn up familiar life. <q>But these organisms, if they exist, would leave traces in the environment,</q> Cleland says.</p>
            
              <p>In 2007 in the journal <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences</em>, Cleland wrote about just such a trace: desert varnish. It&apos;s a strange sheen, like a hardened waterfall, that covers desert rocks all over the planet. The streaks run down rocks from the desert of El Azizia in Libya to Antartica&apos;s Dry Valley. Desert varnish – into which people have scraped petroglyphs for thousands of years – appears layer by layer, growing only the width of a human hair each millennium. The varnish is replete with arsenic, iron and manganese, although the rocks it coats are not. No known geochemical or biological process can account for its ingredients. And yet there it is. Since that discovery, Cleland has urged scientists not to discount – but to seek out – such anomalies as the varnish, things that don&apos;t quite seem to fit. Because maybe they <em>don&apos;t</em> fit.</p>
           
              <p><span class="firstletter">S</span>cience&apos;s modern-day explorers have unearthed increasingly anomalous organisms that are technically <q>familiar life</q> – familiar in that they do adhere to the Central Dogma of molecular biology which explains the flow of genetic information in a biological system. Toxitolerants can live in nuclear waste; acidophiles can live in battery acid; obligate anaerobes die in the presence of oxygen; thermophiles thrive around hot vents deep in the ocean. Life, as they say in the movie <em>Jurassic Park</em>, finds a way.</p>
            
              <p>But even the most familiar forms of life can be difficult to find. According to the latest estimates, we&apos;ve discovered just 14 per cent of the dogma-following species on the planet. Of those, we can make only 1 per cent grow in the lab. A shadow biosphere might help us understand why. <q>Although we have good theoretical reasons for believing that life could be at least modestly different … we don&apos;t know how different it could be,</q> Cleland wrote in the seminal paper <q>The Possibility of Alternative Microbial Life on Earth</q> (2005), co-authored with the astrobiologist Shelley Copley, also of the University of Colorado at Boulder. Just as a hammer and a sledgehammer can both pound a nail, other chemical combinations could lead to organisms that grow, adapt, respond to stimuli, and reproduce – that live, in other words. But which chemicals? And how? To understand that requires going back to the beginning.</p>
            
              <p>Life on Earth might have begun in a <q>warm little pond</q>, as Charles Darwin said, or around an ocean vent. Or it might have come from a Martian meteorite. We just don&apos;t know. What we do know is that half a billion years after Earth became a planet, molecules began to make copies of themselves. Many scientists believe that the first self-replicating molecules – a primitive form of gene-only life – were RNA. This <q>RNA World</q> morphed into an increasingly complex place, where RNA led to DNA and proteins, rendering itself a backseat driver in the process.
             
              <div class="p2"> Others say that a long chain of purely chemical reactions spat out increasingly complicated organic molecules, which then sped up the reactions that produced even more organic molecules. This metabolism led to genetic ingredients after many cycles. And, eventually, to genes themselves.</div></p>

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Maybe different alphabetical combinations are still locked inside ancient organisms that putter invisibly around ocean vents</blockquote>

              <div class="grid-item item3">
                <aside class="inside">
              <p><q>Modern</q> DNA is the eventual conclusion of all the origin stories. DNA has three parts: a sugar called deoxyribose, a phosphate molecule, and one of four nucleic acid bases — either adenine, cyanine, guanine, or thymine (RNA uses another, called uracil, instead of thymine)​. But six other bases occur naturally, and the biodesigner John Chaput of Arizona State University wonders whether different molecules could do what DNA does. Maybe different alphabetical combinations are still locked inside ancient organisms that putter invisibly around ocean vents.</p>
           
              <p>DNA isn&apos;t the only place where other life could diverge, chemically, from the familiar. DNA instructs our bodies to produce certain proteins, which are conglomerations of 20 different amino acids. With the right starting ingredients and a UV nudge, amino acids naturally assemble themselves in the lab. They also coat comets, and their building blocks float aimlessly in interstellar space. They&apos;re easy, abundant. And 100 of them exist. Shadow life could have 80 extra options on their hands (or whatever).</p>
           
              <p><div class="custom-t4">Even the same amino acids our DNA uses could have different shapes.</div> If you make amino acids and sugars in the lab, you get two mirror-image types, called <q>left-handed</q> and <q>right-handed</q>. But inside living things, you&apos;ll find only left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars. Shadow life could be ambidextrous, or a mirror image of regular life: its molecules could be flipped as if Photoshopped. The astronomer Dimitar Sasselov and the geneticist George Church at the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative want to <em>build</em> such mirror-world organisms. One day, they hope, their manufactured microbes will fall ill. <q>If there are right-handed lifeforms out there, many of them will be viruses – which will attempt to hijack the DNA of our bionic cells,</q> Sasselov told <em>The Guardian</em> in 2013. And if viruses attack, we will know viruses exist. And if they exist, some of their prey must exist outside Harvard&apos;s labs, having formed long before Harvard and long before labs.</p>
              
              <p><span class="firstletter">T</span>elling scientists to find a shadow biosphere is like asking a chimpanzee to add oil to a car: they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re looking for or what tools to use. Nevertheless, Cleland has some suggestions. First, look at life in places where life <q>shouldn&apos;t</q> be. Even the most sauna-happy microbes, called hyperthermophiles, wilt above 122° C. If we find anything living at 150° C, then there&apos;s a good chance they’re not of our ilk. Send balloons into the upper atmosphere; scramble up to high plateaus; snowmobile to the South Pole; drive Land Rovers into the Atacama Desert; don end-of-world suits and venture into uranium mines. Remain alert for phenomena that make us say not <q>Eureka!</q> but <q>Huh, that&apos;s weird.</q> And then consider that their explanation might, in fact, be very, very weird.</p>
                         
              <p>Another mysterious finding, like the desert varnish, involves excess gas. If you catalogue all the carbon that living things burp out, and then you count the carbon you find in the atmosphere, the two don&apos;t match: there&apos;s 5 per cent more hanging over our heads than there <q>should</q> be. Maybe that extra comes from shadow organisms whose excretions we aren&apos;t counting. Maybe not.
               
              <span class="p2">Maybe we have already found shadow organisms – some of the shy- and stubborn-seeming microbes that won’t reproduce in our labs, which scientists build as breeding grounds for dogma-obeying life. Maybe they really are just reticent. But we should wonder harder.</p>
              </aside>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">If we look for life only as we know it, that&apos;s all we&apos;re going to find</blockquote>
                <aside class="inside">
              <p>So far, no systematic shadow-search plan exists. But back in 2010, a team led by the astrobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon at NASA did look for weird life in the salty, alkaline, arsenic-saturated waters of Northern California&apos;s Mono Lake. Inside, Wolfe-Simon&apos;s team found an organism that they dubbed GFAJ‑1. All known life on Earth uses phosphorus in its DNA. But when the team deprived GFAJ‑1 of phosphorus, it seemed to substitute the arsenic in its place. This pinch-hitting would kill the cells in your body, because although phosphorus sits just above arsenic on the periodic table and so shares sibling-like traits, the resemblance isn&apos;t quite close enough. But GFAJ-1 seemed to continue just fine using arsenic. While that wouldn&apos;t have made it exactly a shadow organism, it seemed only a step removed: familiar life that could behave, under duress, like shadow life.</p>
           
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item item4">
              <aside class="inside">
              
              <p>The team sent a paper to <em>Science</em>, and NASA rushed a press conference. But Wolfe-Simon&apos;s 15 minutes quickly became infamy, when other scientists failed to replicate her results. The bacteria grew in the arsenic bath, sure, but they still needed – and were still using – phosphorus. Just like a Siberian hermit is still human, GFAJ-1 was just regular life. The team&apos;s minds were perhaps too open to the possibilities, but if we look for life only as we know it, that&apos;s all we&apos;re going to <span class="custom-t2">find.</span></p>
            
           
              <p>The discovery of life as we don&apos;t know it would hint that biology is a universal law, like physics and chemistry. If you drop a trombone off a terrestrial building, it will fall to the ground – every time. If molecular clouds have just the right density, dynamics and ingredients, they will collapse into new stars – every time. If they collapse into new stars, the leftover gas and dust will always collapse into planets. Maybe when those planets have the right ingredients baked at the right temperature, they always make life. A shadow biosphere – evidence that biology emerged more than once on Earth – suggests that biology emerges as a normal consequence of Goldilocks or just‑right conditions, rather than being a mysterious lottery-ticket phenomenon.</p>

              <p>In 1670, when van Leeuwenhoek viewed the invisible microbial world, people were already accustomed to the idea of a world too small to see. It wasn’t really the philosophical existence of that world that set humanity’s throne teetering – it was that world’s newly revealed concreteness and complexity.</p>
              
              <p>Today, if asked whether life concocts itself given the right conditions, many people would respond affirmatively. It&apos;s not a new idea. But concrete, complex proof that we are the predictable result of a predictable law would tip over our throne, <span class="custom-t1">once and for all.</span></p>

<p><span class="person" about="Dansgaard">Dansgaard</span> had plenty of ideas. <q>The development of the ice core drilling technique has led to a broad variety of studies reaching far beyond glaciology itself,</q> he wrote in 1973, and listed a wide range of disciplines – from solar physics to meteorology and atmospheric chemistry – that could benefit from ice-core studies. He also began speculating whether ice cores could be used to predict future climatic conditions and form a baseline against which human impact could be measured. He particularly appealed to the growing community of climate modellers, and asserted that they should use his ice cores to diagnose <q>the processes that cause climatic changes</q> and to check the validity of their models. One can almost imagine <span class="person" about="Dansgaard">Dansgaard</span> showing up at <span class="person" about="Richardson">Richardson&apos;s</span> forecast factory, an ice core under his arm, taking his place along the sides of the enormous theatre and disclosing an entirely new set of numbers to the man on the central pulpit.</p>

              <p><span class="firstletter">I</span>n the early 1970s, <span class="person" about="Dansgaard">Dansgaard</span> was far from alone in his ambition to bring together long, planetary timescales with the surging scientific field of climate modelling. Ice cores were lined up along with other climate archives – deep-sea sediments, ancient pollen samples, corals, tree rings – that could now be translated into one coherent climate system. But the archives alone were not enough: while <span class="person" about="Dansgaard">Dansgaard</span> and his colleagues were drilling through the <span class="place" about="Greenland">Greenland</span> ice sheets, a new generation of meteorologists and climate modellers had developed increasingly advanced methods to calculate and predict future climate conditions. What began as an ambition to predict short-term changes in the weather, an ambition shared by <span class="place" about="Richardson">Richardson</span>, was growing temporally and spatially. The first <span class="concept" about="GCM">General Circulation Models</span> (GCMs), developed to quantify atmospheric processes on monthly or seasonal timescales, were produced in the 1960s. But these models were still rudimentary, produced by small teams, and could give only fragmented and partial answers to the questions the modellers asked them. New questions were also emerging. As the leading climate scientist <span class="person" about="Kellog">William Welch Kellogg</span> wrote in 1971, <q>the haunting realisation</q> that humanity could alter Earth&apos;s climate had become <span class="custom-t1"><q>one of the most important questions of our time</q>.</span></p>
              
              <p>In the years after Kellogg&apos;s realisation, different components of the quantified planet began coming together: the coordinated global data gathered by the <span class="concept" about="IGY">IGY</span>, the deep timescales made visible in ice cores and other climate archives, and the growing concern for human impact on planetary dynamics were drawn into one coherent model. While the <span class="concept" about="GCM">GCMs</span> were able to <q>calculate</q> the immensely complex atmosphere, a new generation of models aimed to conceptualise the <em>entire</em> <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> as a system consisting of interacting components. If each of these components – whether oceans, atmosphere or polar regions – could be quantified and modelled in relation to each other, the argument went, it could be possible to produce models of the <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> system.</p>
            
              <p>Making models on such a large scale, involving so many metrics and components, also necessitated a great deal of pragmatism. Computing power is not infinite. Each process entering the model had to be reduced to a manageable scale, translating complex local variabilities into standardised algorithms. As <span class="concept" about="ESM">Earth System Models</span> (ESMs) gradually replaced <span class="concept" about="GCM">GCMs</span>, the ambition of modelling the planet grew in scope but remained surprisingly modest: the goal became far more wide reaching but did not necessitate any dramatic increase in data collection. The late <span class="person" about="Bretherton">Francis Bretherton</span>, a mathematician and former chairman of NASA&apos;s Earth System Science Committee, outlined the philosophy of his research agenda in an interview in <em>Science</em> in 1986: <q>Many of the observations we need are already being made for other reasons, such as weather forecasting.</q> The difference from previous approaches, he believed, was intellectual rather than technological: <q>It&apos;s more an attitude of mind. We want to make sure that we go the extra mile – that we cover everything.</q> The perspective was shifting. It appeared that the models could encompass far more phenomena than had previously seemed possible.</p>

              <p>The recent turn towards the planetary must be understood as the outcome of a longer scientific history of conceptualising planetary dynamics and fantasies of planetary monitoring. <span class="p1">The planet has, in one sense, always been here but, in another, it has just recently appeared.</span> In the century since <span class="person" about="Richardson">Richardson</span> shared his fantasy, an immense mobilisation of science and technology, as well as political and financial interest in planetary dynamics, has fundamentally altered the relationship between <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> and its human inhabitants. At the same time, the human pressure on the <span class="place" about="Earth">Earth</span> system has reached unprecedented, and potentially disastrous, proportions. The knowledge of the planet as an interconnected system has co-evolved with the acceleration of human impacts on the system.</p>

              <p>It&apos;s somewhat surprising how well <span class="person" about="Richardson">Richardson&apos;s</span> model of the forecast factory has held up, given the dramatic expansion of knowledge in the past 100 years and the insight that humanity is not just living with climate, but effectively interfering in it. <span class="person" about="Richardson">Richardson</span> was merely fantasising about improving short-term weather prediction, which at the time seemed like a wild dream, and yet the same model of gathering data from across the world to produce synchronous models of planetary dynamics has remained remarkably intact. Early numerical weather prediction produced highly scalable models for calculating the weather, which were gradually scaled up to encompass an ever-increasing number of metrics and variables – increasing even now.</p>

              <p>Global coordinated scientific projects, from the <span class="concept" about="IGY">International Geophysical Year</span> to <span class="person" about="Dansgaard">Dansgaard&apos;s</span> ice cores, are emblematic of how new categories and datasets have entered a pre-existing framework. With the establishment of Earth system science in the 1980s, the forecast factory expanded into a multitude of processes, as well as into the domain of politics. While <span class="person" about="Richardson">Richardson</span> was living at a time when human impact was not a factor to reckon with, his fantasy has remained intact even as humanity steps into the foreground of the very processes the factory aims to forecast. With the planet emerging as this century&apos;s prime political object, understanding its history can help us recognise how the <em>planetary</em>, despite its seemingly unequivocal nature, carries a politics of its own. This new Earth – calculable, predictable, overseen and singular – did not rise in a vacuum.</p>
